Welcome! This is Xinzhe, currently working toward my PhD degree in statistics with the [School of Data Science, Fudan University](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiahai Zhuang](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/). My research interests involve the interdisciplinary area of medical image computing, statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. I am currently working on using statistical modelling and machine learning techniques to achieve multimodal groupwise image analysis, including groupwise registration and combined computing of cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images.
