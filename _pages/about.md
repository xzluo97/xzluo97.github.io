Welcome! This is Xinzhe. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) & [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/), Imperial College London, working with [Dr. Chen Qin](https://cq615.github.io) and [Dr. Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/). Previously, I obtained my BSc degree in Mathematics (2019) and PhD degree in Statistics (2024) from Fudan University. My research interests involve the interdisciplinary area of medical imaging, statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. Currently, I am focusing on trustworthy AI for MRI reconstruction and inverse problems.
