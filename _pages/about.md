> “The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way. Hundreds of people can talk for one who can think, but thousands can think for one who can see. To see clearly is poetry, prophecy and religion, all in one.” — John Ruskin

Welcome! This is Xinzhe, currently working toward my PhD degree in statistics with the [School of Data Science, Fudan University](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiahai Zhuang](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/). My research interests involve the interdisciplinary area of medical image computing, statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. I am currently working on using statistical modelling and machine learning techniques to achieve multimodal groupwise image analysis, including groupwise registration and combined computing of cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images.
