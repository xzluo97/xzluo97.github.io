Welcome! This is Xinzhe. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering/) & [I-X](https://ix.imperial.ac.uk/), Imperial College London, working with [Dr. Chen Qin](https://cq615.github.io), [Dr. Yingzhen Li](http://yingzhenli.net/home/en/), and [Prof. Ben Glocker](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/b.glocker). Previously, I obtained my BSc degree in Mathematics and PhD degree in Statistics from Fudan University in 2019 and 2024, respectively. My research interests involve the interdisciplinary area of medical image computing, statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. Currently, I am focusing on trustworthy AI for MRI reconstruction.
