# Introduction

Hi, I am Xinzhe, currently working toward my PhD degree in statistics with the [School of Data Science, Fudan University](https://sds.fudan.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Xiahai Zhuang](https://zmiclab.github.io/zxh/). I am interested in the interdisciplinary area of medical image computing, statistics, artificial intelligence, and mathematics. I am currently working on using statistical modelling and machine learning to achieve multimodal groupwise image analysis.
